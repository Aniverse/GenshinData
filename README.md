# GenshinData
Repository containing the game data for the game Genshin Impact.

This repository is a work in progress between @FZFalzar and I. Also, expect things to change. And before you ask, no.

Setting this up to automatically update is impossible, as generally big patches might change the tables designs and add new ones and they have to be manually done. :( Why are we here, still to suffer?

~~There was an older repository originally but it ended up being used for diffs and testing.~~ ~~Also stop believing everything that ""gets leaked.""~~
